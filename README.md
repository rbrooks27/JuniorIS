# OrgoNizer - (Multistep Synthesis Organic Chemistry)
The purpose of this project is to design and implement an interactive software system that teaches multistep synthesis through decision trees and constraint satisfaction techniques. By breaking synthesis into a sequence of guided yes/no decisions, the system will reinforce fundamentals and provide educational feedback at each step. 
While professional chemistry tools existâ€”such as ChemDraw or Reaxys--these platforms are not designed for novice learners. This project fills the gap by prioritizing transparency, interpretability, and pedagogy over raw prediction power.
