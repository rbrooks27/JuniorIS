The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}

abstract = {Constraint satisfaction is becoming the paradigm of choice for solving many real-world problems. To date, most approaches to constraint satisfaction have focused on solving a problem using some form of backtrack search. Furthermore, the typical view is that a constraint satisfaction problem will be solved only once. However, in many real-world contexts, problems are solved repeatedly over time. Also such problems often exhibit some structure. This motivates the application of some form of learning to improve the performance of search from previously discovered solutions. In this paper we present an approach that uses knowledge about known solutions to a problem to improve search. The approach we present is based on a combination of decision tree learning and constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate that significant improvements, almost an order-of-magnitude, in search effort can be achieved using this hybrid approach over traditional search. We also show that the space complexity using this approach is almost negligible. This work is of interest in domains such as product configuration, and interactive constraint solving in general where the system takes the initiative by asking questions.},

The paper presents experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvements, often achieving nearly an order-of-magnitude reduction in search effort. This approach is particularly relevant for applications such as product configuration and interactive constraint solving, where problems are solved repeatedly over time. The article provides valuable insights into how machine learning techniques can be integrated with constraint satisfaction to optimize problem-solving processes.

Previous work has considered exact optimization formulations that can guarantee optimal clustering while satisfying all constraints, however these approaches lack interpretability. Recently, decision trees have been used to produce inherently interpretable clustering solutions, however existing approaches do not support clustering constraints and do not provide strong theoretical guarantees on solution quality. In thiswork, we present a novel SAT-based framework for interpretable clustering that supports clustering constraints and that also provides strong theoretical guarantees on solution quality. We also present new insight into the trade-off between interpretability and satisfaction of such user-provided constraints. Our framework is the first approach for interpretable and constrained clustering. Experiments with a range of real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach can produce high-quality and interpretable constrained clustering solutions.},

Recently, computer-aided retrosynthesis is finding renewed interest from both chemistry and computer science communities. Most existing approaches rely on template-based models that define subgraph matching rules, but whether or not a chemical reaction can proceed is not defined by hard decision rules. In this work, we propose a new approach to this task using the Conditional Graph Logic Network, a conditional graphical model built upon graph neural networks that learns when rules from reaction templates should be applied, implicitly considering whether the resulting reaction would be both chemically feasible and strategic. We also propose an efficient hierarchical sampling to alleviate the computation cost. While achieving a significant improvement of 8.2\% over current state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset, our model also offers interpretations for the prediction.},

Recently, neural architectures analog to image captioning have been explored to solve this task, yet they still show to be data inefficient, using millions of examples just to show performances comparable with traditional methods. Looking to motivate and benchmark new approaches based on atomic-level entities detection and graph reconstruction, we present CEDe, a unique collection of chemical entity bounding boxes manually curated by experts for scientific literature datasets. These annotations combine to more than 700,000 chemical entity bounding boxes with the necessary information for structure reconstruction. Also, a large synthetic dataset containing one million molecular images and annotations is released in order to explore transfer-learning techniques that could help these architectures perform better under low-data regimes.
